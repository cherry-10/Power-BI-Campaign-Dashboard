🔍 Insights
Campaign 2 was the most efficient with the highest impressions (67K) and clicks (3.7K) for a moderate spend.

Campaign 1 had the highest spend but didn’t perform proportionately in terms of clicks.

The dashboard helps quickly identify high- and low-performing campaigns to optimize future budget allocation.
